# Continental Vision

Expand thinking beyond immediate boundaries to find natural coalitions, shared enemies, and larger visions that unite formerly separate actors.

**Source Expert:** Simon Bolivar
**Category:** Strategy / Coalition Building

---

## When to Use

- You're too small to compete alone against established players
- Multiple actors face the same problem but aren't coordinating
- You need to build a coalition for collective action
- Your current scope limits your options
- You need to reframe a local fight as part of a larger movement

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "How do we think bigger?"
- "We need allies"
- "We're too small to compete alone"
- "How do we build a coalition?"
- "Who else has this problem?"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `current_scope` | Yes | Your current position, market, or effort |
| `challenge` | Yes | What you're struggling against |
| `goal` | Yes | What you're ultimately trying to achieve |
| `known_actors` | No | Others who might share your interest |

## Workflow
### Step 1: The Bolivar Vision

Bolivar didn't fight to liberate Venezuela alone—he envisioned a united South America. This continental scope:
- Allowed him to find allies (Haiti) others hadn't considered
- Created a narrative larger than any single nation
- Built momentum that crossed borders
- Ultimately led to the Congress of Panama (1826)

Even when the dream of Gran Colombia fragmented, the continental vision had made liberation possible.

### Step 2: Framework

**1. Name the Larger Fight**

Your struggle is part of something bigger:
- What systemic problem creates your local challenge?
- What movement are you part of, even if you didn't know it?
- Who else, in other markets/industries/regions, faces the same enemy?
- If you zoom out three levels, what do you see?

*Bolivar saw not Venezuelan independence but American liberation from European colonialism.*

**2. Map the Potential Coalition**

Who shares your interest, explicitly or implicitly?

| Actor Type | Identification |
|------------|----------------|
| **Natural allies** | Same enemy, same goals |
| **Adjacent actors** | Similar problems, different contexts |
| **Neutral parties** | Could benefit from your success |
| **Convertible opponents** | Currently against you but interests could align |
| **Resource holders** | Have what you need, need what you have |

**3. Find the Shared Enemy**

Coalitions unite against something:
- What common threat creates natural alliance?
- What would coalition members lose if you all fail separately?
- How is the enemy stronger because you're fragmented?
- What narrative makes this a shared fight?

**4. Design the Minimal Unifying Vision**

What's the smallest vision all coalition members can commit to?
- Don't require agreement on everything
- Find the intersection of interests
- Create a banner broad enough to stand under together
- Leave details for later (after victory)

*Bolivar's Congress of Panama sought mutual defense and cooperation, not detailed governance.*

**5. Offer Value Before Asking**

What can you give the coalition before asking for anything?
- Information? Access? Platform?
- First-mover on shared problem?
- Legitimacy or credibility?
- Resources others lack?

*Bolivar promised Haiti he would abolish slavery—he offered something his ally valued.*

**6. Build the Bridge Structure**

How will the coalition actually function?
- What commitments does membership require?
- How are decisions made?
- What happens when interests diverge?
- Who coordinates, and with what authority?

## Coalition Map

| Actor | Type | Shared Interest | What They Bring | What They Need |
|-------|------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| [name] | [natural/adjacent/neutral/convertible] | [common ground] | [value] | [requirement] |

## Your Offer

**Before Asking, You Give:**
1. [Value you provide to coalition]
2. [Value you provide to coalition]

## Bridge Structure

**Coordination Model:** [How decisions get made]
**Membership Requirements:** [What's required to be "in"]
**Divergence Protocol:** [What happens when interests conflict]

## First Coalition Actions

1. [Immediate outreach]
2. [Immediate outreach]

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input:**
- Current scope: One regional credit union trying to compete with big banks on digital experience
- Challenge: Can't afford the technology investment big banks make
- Goal: Provide members with modern digital banking

**Output:**

## Scope Expansion

**Current Scope:** Regional credit union competing alone against banks with 100x our technology budget
**Continental Scope:** The entire credit union movement (6,000+ US credit unions) facing digital disruption
**Why Expansion Matters:** Collective technology investment. Shared development. Combined bargaining power. One credit union can't build a $50M app; 500 credit unions each contributing $100K can.

## Coalition Map

| Actor | Type | Shared Interest | What They Bring | What They Need |
|-------|------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Other regional CUs | Natural ally | Same competitive pressure | Funding, member base | Technology solution |
| CUNA (trade association) | Natural ally | Member success | Coordination infrastructure, legitimacy | Member-led initiatives |
| Fintech vendors | Adjacent | Revenue from CU market | Technology capability | Market access, credibility |
| Small banks | Convertible | Same digital pressure | Possible funding | May be skeptical of CU partnership |
| Open-source banking projects | Resource holder | Adoption | Code, architecture | Deployment partners |

## The Shared Enemy

**Common Threat:** Big banks and neobanks are winning members with digital experience credit unions can't match individually
**Cost of Fragmentation:** Each CU builds mediocre tech in isolation; members leave for Chase and Chime
**Enemy's Advantage:** They win because credit unions fight separately; consolidated banking can invest at scale

## Unifying Vision

**The Banner:** "Together, we build technology no credit union could build alone—and every credit union owns it"
**What It Requires:**
- Financial contribution (scaled to size)
- Commitment to shared roadmap
- Willingness to adopt common standards
**What It Doesn't Require:**
- Agreement on governance, lending policies, or membership criteria
- Giving up independence
- Using all shared tools (pick what fits)

## Your Offer

**Before Asking, You Give:**
1. Open-source the mobile app codebase we've already built (imperfect but real)
2. Share our digital transformation playbook (what worked, what didn't)
3. Host the first meeting, take on coordination burden initially

## Bridge Structure

**Coordination Model:** Steering committee of 7 CUs (rotating), decisions by supermajority for major investments
**Membership Requirements:** Financial contribution (0.5% of assets, min $10K), adopt shared identity standards
**Divergence Protocol:** Any CU can fork the code and leave; shared investment stays with coalition

## First Coalition Actions

1. Call 5 credit union CEOs I know personally this week
2. Propose presentation to CUNA technology council next month
3. Publish open letter: "A Call for Credit Union Technology Unity"

## Anti-Patterns

**DON'T:**
- Require full agreement before acting (coalitions form around shared interest, not shared everything)
- Forget that others have their own interests (they join for their reasons, not yours)
- Build coalition you expect to control (you're a member, not emperor)
- Ignore cultural and political differences (the llaneros had different values than Bolivar's urban base)
- Wait for perfect conditions (the Congress of Panama wasn't perfect, but it happened)

**The Test:** If your "coalition" is really just people helping you achieve your goals, it's not a coalition—it's a favor network.

## Integration

This skill pairs with:
- **Resilience Through Defeat:** Finding new allies after setback
- **Revolutionary Rhetoric:** Crafting the message that unites the coalition
- **Cultural Integration:** Making diverse coalition members work together
- **Strategic Patience Assessment:** Knowing when coalition is ready to act
